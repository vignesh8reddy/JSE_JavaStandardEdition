    1. After compilation of code, java class is loaded from .class file
    2. Static members are assigned memory during compile-time itself.
    3. When class is loaded, first of all, static blocks are executed in the order.
    4. Then, during it's Object creation, memory would be assigned to non-static members.
    5. After that, all the normal blocks would be executed in the order
    6. Then, constructor would be executed

    A class will be loaded right before creation of its object.
    If no object is created for a class then, the class is not loaded.
