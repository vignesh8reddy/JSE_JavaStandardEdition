    /*
	class constructor can not be static, final and abstract;
	One of the important property of java constructor is that it can not be static.
 	We know static keyword belongs to a class rather than the object of a class.
  	A constructor is called when an object of a class is created, so no use of the static constructor.

 	Constructors are not inherited in java. Therefore, constructors are not subject to hiding or overriding.
  	When there is no chance of constructor overriding, there is no chance of modification also. When there is
   	no chance of modification, then no sense of restricting modification there.
